## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Erick, aspiring business analyst currently enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. So far I've learned about and feel comfortable with Excel, SQL, and data visualization (Tableau). Now, I'm eager to apply my data analysis and visualization skills in a role where I can contribute, grow, and make a meaningful impact.

Currently, I'm working on wrapping up with the TripleTen BIA course so I can get in the field soon!

Some facts about me:
  - I enjoy troubleshooting, keeps me from being bored
  - I'm currently a maintenance technician so I'm good with my hands and am happy to be able to do work around my own home
  - I consider myself a creative, having worked on songwriting, album artwork, photography, and styling
  - I'm a huge sports and sports-stats fan
  - My goals for the rest of 2025: land my dream job as a Business Analyst and personally grow as an individual
